## Dataset Description
This repository contains real-time battery power consumption data collected from a Google Pixel 8. It includes raw traces of specific activities and synthetic scenarios generated for battery life prediction and power modeling.

- Device: Google Pixel 8
- Method: Custom Python script collecting system metrics via ADB.
- Sampling Rate: ~1 Hz
- Key Metrics: Voltage, current, CPU load, screen status, network usage, and temperature.

- `pixel8_training_data.csv`: Aggregated training dataset with features and labels.
- `scenarios/` (Simulated): Complex usage patterns generated by `build_scenarios.py`.

## Feature Overview

| Feature | Unit | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `time_s` | s | Timeline (relative). |
| `voltage_v` | V | Battery voltage. |
| `current_ma` | mA | Battery current (absolute value). |
| `power_w` | W | Calculated power (`voltage` * `current` / 1000). |
| `cpu` | 0-1 | Total CPU load. |
| `s_on` | 0/1 | Screen state (1 = On). |
| `br` | 0-255 | Screen brightness level. |
| `net_kbps` | KB/s | Network throughput. |
| `temp_c` | °C | Battery temperature. |

## Simulated Scenarios

Synthetic profiles generated by mixing raw traces:

- **Hardcore Gamer:** High load. 75% Gaming, 15% Video, remainder Social/Idle.
- **Binge Watcher:** Media focus. 80% Video playback, 10% Social, 10% Idle.
- **Binge Scroller:** 65% Social media, mixed with Video and minimal Camera usage.
- **Office Worker:** Low load. 65% Idle, with intermittent Social and Video use.
- **Polar Researcher:** Same usage as "Office" but with a **-25°C temperature offset** to simulate extreme cold.
